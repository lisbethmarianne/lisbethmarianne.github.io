Ruby is first programming language I learned for real. Some of the many things I did while learning were little games you can play from the command line. I believe it is fun doing little games and playing around with the code while you are learning a language.

Find the code for tic tac toe, mastermind and hangman on my [GitHub account][github]. You can play them in your terminal by running, e.g.

{% highlight bash %}
  ruby hangman.rb
{% endhighlight %}
