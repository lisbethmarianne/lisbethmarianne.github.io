### Markdown Previewer

The user can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area. The user can see a preview of the output of the markdown that is updated as they types. Uses [marked][marked], a markdown parser and compiler.

{% include pen-markdownpreviewer.html %}


### Recipe Box

The user can create recipes that have names, ingredients and instructions. The user can add new, edit and delete recipes. All new recipes are saved in the browser's local storage. Upon page refresh, these recipes will still be there.

{% include pen-recipebox.html %}
