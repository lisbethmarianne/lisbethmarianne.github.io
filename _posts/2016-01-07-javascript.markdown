I made some small projects with JavaScript and jQuery.

First is a *sketchpad*, where divs get colored differenty when you mouseover them. There are different options for drawing.

{% include pen-sketchpad.html %}

Second one is a simple *calculator*. It is possible to chain mathematical operations together until hitting the equal button, and the calculator will tell the correct output.

{% include pen-calculator.html %}

Third is a *Pomodoro Clock*. The user can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed, a break of 5 minutes follows, then the next pomodoro starts. The user can reset the clock and customize the length of the pomodoro session and break.

{% include pen-pomodoro.html %}

The forth project is the classic game *Tic Tac Toe*. The user can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer. The game will reset as soon as it's over so the user can play again. It is possible to choose whether one wants to play as X or O.
