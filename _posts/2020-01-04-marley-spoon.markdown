Since January 2017 I'm working for the Logistics Team at [Marley Spoon][marleyspoon] a meal-kit delivery company.

In the Logistics team at Marley Spoon we deal with delivery option management and integrations with external shippers on a daily basis.
We are building an independent logistics platform by extracting from monolithic legacy application and we play a big part in the implementation of an event based system architecture using Apache Kafka to connect all the pieces of the marley spoon system.

With a newly build internal application me and my team made it possible for Logistics managers to change delivery coverage and delivery windows as they see fit.

I also worked with different APIs from our carriers to request shipping labels and/or to register shipments for planning purposes (e.g. Shippo, PostNL, DPD, Liefery).
