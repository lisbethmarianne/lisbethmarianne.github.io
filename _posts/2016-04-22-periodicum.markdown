Together with the very talented Conny Kawohl ([Twitter][conny-twitter]/[Github][conny-github]) I am working on an interactive periodic table. This single page app is made with node.js and React.js.

At the moment it consists of two main views. The periodic table overview, presenting all the elements:

And the single element view, with a picture representing the element and various information about the element:

We are currently trying to implement some filters and searches, e.g. for the various groups elements belong to like noble gases.
