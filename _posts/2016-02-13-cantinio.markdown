Since November 2015 I'm working for Loock & Humphreys GbR at a Ruby on Rails App called [cantinio.com][cantinio]. There are a lot of great lunch options in metropolitan areas and cantinio.com was created to help, find and enjoy them. The service is free and open to all, restaurants and users.

I do build new features as well as identifying and fixing bugs.
Features I am/was working on include forwarding new updates to Facebook, Twitter and Slack and a simple job board with payment via Stripe.

The App is still quite new and it needs more restaurants and users to become really successful. I believe it is a really cool idea and I look forward to using it in the future.

Visit the [Website][cantinio]. The code is private and was recently moved from [bitbucket][bitbucket] to [gitlab][gitlab], which looks so much nicer (it has a cute fox as a logo) and it comes with Continuous Integration.
