Together with the lovely [Ruby Monstas][rubymonstas] and [Travis Foundation][travis-foundation] I've been working on a Ruby on Rails App since July 2015. At [diversitytickets.org][diversitytickets] conferences can offer free tickets, travel grants or accommodation for their event to minority groups like women in tech.
