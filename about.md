Hi!

I'm Katrin from Berlin. I am a self-taught software developer. I learned through different online resources and with the help of a RailsGirls study group, [Ruby Monstas](http://rubymonstas.org/), that I joined in March 2015.
Before my carreer change I was a biochemist with a PhD working in research and teaching.

I'm currently looking for a position (Junior/Internship) with the possibility to learn and grow personally and professionally. I enjoy developing throughout the stack. I am eager to learn new things and I am quick to pick up new languages and skills.

**Technologies used:**\\
*Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Minitest\\
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React\\
Git, GitHub, GitLab\\
... always learning something new*

**Events visited:**\\
*RailsGirls Workshop (March 2015)\\
Eurucamp (Juli/August 2015)\\
RailsGirls Workshop as coach (October/November 2015)\\
Clojure Workshop (January 2016)\\
Coach the coaches (April 2016) \\
RailsGirls Workshop as coach (April 2016)\\
RUG::B, Berlin.JS, Nodeschool meetings (regularly)*

You can find me every Monday at the [Ruby Monstas](http://rubymonstas.org/) meeting.

You might ask yourself, why the name lisbethmarianne? That is a combination of my grandmothers names. I like the combination, well it is better than claushelmut.
