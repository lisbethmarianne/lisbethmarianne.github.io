Hi!

I'm Katrin from Berlin. I am a self-taught software developer. I learned through different online resources and with the help of a RailsGirls study group, [Ruby Monstas](http://rubymonstas.org/), that I joined in March 2015.
Before my carreer change I was a biochemist with a PhD working in research and teaching.

I enjoy learning new things and am quick to pick up new languages and skills.

You might ask yourself, why the name lisbethmarianne? That is a combination of my grandmothers names. I like the combination, well it is better than claushelmut.
