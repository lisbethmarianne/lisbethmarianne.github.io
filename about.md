Hi!

I'm Katrin from Berlin. I am a self-taught software developer. I learned through different online resources and with the help of a study group, [Ruby Monstas](http://rubymonstas.org/).
Before my career change I was a biochemist with a PhD working in research and teaching.

You can find me every Tuesday at the [RubyCorns](http://rubycorns.club/) meeting that I am hosting at the Marley Spoon office at Paul-Linke-Ufer 39/40.

You might ask yourself, why the name lisbethmarianne? That is a combination of my grandmothers names. I like the combination, well it is better than claushelmut.
